		<h3>Understanding SQL</h3>

		<p>SQL is the more traditional approach to a database. An SQL database stores data in a table, which is great for handling structured data, in other words, data which is very predictable and organized. An example of structured data may be a search engine, which requires organized and predictable data to provide the proper results. An alternative to SQL, NoSQL, has gained popularity with the advent of gaming and social networks as it allows for more flexibility, such as allowing the addition of new properties on the fly, as well as for better handling on non-structured data, or data that is likely to be manipulated and changed frequently.</p>

		<p><a href="https://blog.udemy.com/beginners-guide-to-sql/">Udemy Beginners guide to SQL</a> - I like this blog post, because it provides a simple to follow guide to understand basic SQL. Beginning with an introduction to the theory behind SQL, and then progressing into beginner SQL commands, which build upon the theory outlined at the beginning of the post. I also like that the post stays true to its goal of being a beginner guide, not delving too deep into concepts which are unnecessary to a beginner.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql">Kahn Academy</a> - Kahn Academy is a proven resource for learning a wide variety of subjects. Their video format is very helpful in gaining a visual understanding of concepts. Their introduction to SQL feels familiar to anybody who has used the website before, with concepts slowly building on top of each other. While less theory focused than the previous resource from udemy.com, the Kahn academy guide provides a great resource to jump straight into SQL commands.</p>
