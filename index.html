		<h3>Understanding Back-End Servers</h3>

		<p>A backend server handles any processes that do not take place on a user&apos;s machine. This is contrary to the &quot;front end&quot; which handles processes such as Visuals, and anything that runs on a user&apos;s computer. Processes associated with a backend server include database processing as well as server side code, or in other words the customized response to user requests to the webserver.</p>

		<p>Resources for understanding servers:</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> provides quality videos created by industry experts. Though not an extensive directory of backend techniques, Pluralsight may be a practical first step towards beginning a new backend project.</p>

		<p><a href="https://hackhands.com">Hackhands</a> allows for hands on, live help, via a shared screen. This may be very helpful when learning about servers as it allows for direct input from an expert in their field. This system works as a more personalized and interactive version of the information provided on Pluralsight.</p>

		<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a> provides a vast community sharing resources for coding help. When learning a new language it may be helpful to have a resource where people can answer the questions you have. Because stack overflow is based on community input, it may not always be the most reliable source. However, code found on stack overflow may work as a good building block on which to expand ones coding knowledge. In the case of SQL it may be practical to have access to lots of community written code, as well as answers to question one may have regarding the new language.</p>
