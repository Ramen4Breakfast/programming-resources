		<h3>Understanding Promises in ES6</h3>

		<p>The first resource I used to answer the question regarding promises in ES6 was An introdutioin to ES6 on a ventro.com blog. The reason I used this resource first was to gain a basic understanding of what ES6 is. Without knowing what ES6 is, and how its basic functions work, I think it would be much more difficult to understand the principle of promises. From this I learned that ES6 is the latest version of JS, the successor to ES5.</p>

		<p>The second resource was used to learn about the basics of promises in ES6 is a in introdutory guide to promises titles JS promises for dummies. From this resource I learned that promises, while not a new function to JS, are being handled &quot;out of the box&quot; for the first time in ES6. Prior to ES6, promises had to be added via a promise library such as bluebird. Because of the native integration of promises in ES6, any code involving promises works straight out of the box. This resource also provides basic examples of promise integration, using analogies helpful to a beginner.</p>

		<p>The final resource provides an outline of how promises operate in JS was the Mozilla developers guide to promises. From this resource I learned that a promise acts as a proxy for a value that may not be known when the promise was created. In other words, a promise allows for the creation a pending value who&apos;s outcome will be determined once the value has been allocated. This resource also provides lots of information regarding the usage and implementation of promises.</p>
