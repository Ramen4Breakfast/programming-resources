		<h3>Understanding Git Merges</h3>

		<p>In order to understand merges in git, a useful resource is the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs">Git documentation website</a>, specifically the section regarding <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge">git merges</a>. This resource provides an overview of the git merge command, as well as how to handle various processes involving git merge. Processes such as resolving conflicts. This resource does a good job at addressing the commands that will be useful in addressing the various scenarios which may arise due to a git merge.</p>

		<p>On my mac, it would appear as though a text editor is opened within the terminal upon merging. To resolve a conflict, I must navigate to the file which has an error to be resolved and execute a git status command. I then have to open my text editor, in my case sublime text, and manually remove the conflict indicators <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>. I must then make the proper changes to the code to resolve the conflict caused because of the merge. Once the conflicts have been resolved, the changes must be added, committed, and pushed into the repository. </p>
